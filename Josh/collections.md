The Numix icon themes are split into three collections based on their style, and so the symbols each one uses. Themes within the same collection will have the same level of completeness too. For example, if an icon is in Circle it will be in Square because they're in the same collection, but the same icon may not necessarily by in Fold because it is in a different one.
