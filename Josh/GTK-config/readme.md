Numix GTK Config
================

This is a launcher for ```gtk-theme-config```, a utility which allows users to choose the colours being used in the installed GTK theme. Simply place the ```numix-gtk.desktop``` in ```/usr/share/applications``` and ```numix.svg``` in ```/usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/``` and the applications will appear in your launcher of choice.
